## Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm an MSc Quantitative Finance student with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistical modelling, R and Python programming.
📊 I'm interested in systematic trading through statistical arbitrage, and in the application of mathematics to derivatives pricing.
💻 My technical toolkit includes Python, pandas, NumPy, R Studio, and time series analysis.  
🧠 Recent mini-projects include:
- Pair trading strategy with dynamic hedge ratio using Kalman filter
- LSTM-based momentum strategy using historical stock returns  
- Replication of factor models based on academic literature  
- Statistical arbitrage using co-integrations  

🚀 I'm passionate about solving financial problems through mathematical rigor and computational methods.
